<p>Power-FI is an integrated solution for your electronic needs.</p>
The objective of this project is to develop a portable charger that can be deployed anywhere to<br>
provide power to charge electronic devices and, at the same time, act as a wireless hotspot. The<br>
2.4GHz wireless piggybacking off 4G cell towers gives it the ability to connect <br>
several devices at once. A Central Control Unit (CCU) will handle all the device’s functionality <br> 
so that maintenance and user configuration is <br>
minimal. As settings are applied to the CCU, they are automatically updated and propagated <br>
through the device’s other connected modules. For the customer, the product should be easy <br>
and simple to use, with minimal setup. It can be configured for a wide-range of scenarios via an <br>
intuitive web-based User Interface.
